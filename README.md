Total AI (TAI) is a complete free open source agent based AI Framework for Unity. TAI is currently in Alpha.

The core of TAI are Agents who can to sense the world, create memories, plans, and act in order to either reduce their Drives or based on the action with the most utility. This is accomplished with its Type System and Plan/Mapping System. It is also easy to extend and customize through ScriptableObject's pluggable data and logic ability. This makes writing and plugging in your own custom AI logic easy.

<b>Total AI is currently in Alpha so expect bugs/issues.</b>

## Contribute
Total AI was just launched as an open source project.
This is a great time to jump in and have a major impact on the current and future development of Total AI.

See <a href="http://totalai.org/contrib-introduction.html">Contribute Documentation</a> for more Information.

## Integrations
Due to Total AI's comprehesive Type System intregrating your Asset with Total AI should be simple.
For example if your Asset is agent Sensors, you will just need to create custom SensorTypes that call your Sensors.

Let us know if you have an integration in your repo and/or would like us to create a separate repo for your TAI integration.

## Type Packs
Did you create a set of Types for a certain style of game and want to contribute?  Consider making a Type Pack so
others can use it to quick start their game.  Let us know and we'll add a repo for it.

## Add-Ons
Did you create a set of Types for a certain Unity feature?  For example a type system for Unity's Animation Rigging System.
Consider turing it into an Add-On so others can use it.  Let us know and we'll add a repo for it.
