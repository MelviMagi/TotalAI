Total AI (TAI) is a complete free open source agent based AI Framework for Unity.
Its goals are to provide an easy to prototype, flexible, fully customizable, and performant framework
for a broad array of AI types and for a broad array of game types.  Eventually TAI hopes to have a
vast library of community created types that anyone can use to jumpstart their AI.

The core of TAI are Agents who can to sense the world, create memories, plans, and act in order to
reduce their Drives based on the Mapping (the core unit of planning) with the most utility. This is accomplished with its Type System
and Plan/Mapping System. It is also easy to extend and customize through ScriptableObject's pluggable data
and logic ability. This makes writing and plugging in your own custom AI logic easy.


## Contribute
Total AI was just launched as an open source project.
This is a great time to jump in and have a major impact on the current and future development of Total AI.

See <a href="http://totalai.org/contrib-introduction.html">Contribute Documentation</a> for more Information.

## In Planning/Development

## Integrations
Due to Total AI's comprehesive Type System intregrating your Asset with Total AI should be simple.
For example if your Asset is agent Sensors, you will just need to create custom
<a href="http://totalai.org/doc-sensortype.html">Sensor Types</a> that call your Sensors.

Let us know if you have an integration in your repo and/or would like us to create a separate repo for your TAI integration.

## Type Packs
Did you create a set of Types for a certain style of game and want to contribute?  Consider making a Type Pack so
others can use it to quick start their game.  Let us know and we'll add a repo for it.

## Add-Ons
Did you create a set of Types for a certain Unity feature?  For example a type system for Unity's Animation Rigging System.
Consider turning it into an Add-On so others can use it.  Let us know and we'll add a repo for it.
